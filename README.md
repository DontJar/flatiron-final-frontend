# Loggr

Loggr was created by [Jon Schulman](https://github.com/DontJar/) using React frontend and Rails backend, and a live demo can be accessed [here](http://project-loggr.herokuapp.com/).

Please bear in mind that Loggr is designed to be viewed from a mobile device, and your experiences may be adversely affected if viewing from a non-mobile platform.

## Enjoy!
